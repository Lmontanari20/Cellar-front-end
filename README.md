# Cellr

The goal of this app is to provide the user with the ability to create a wine cellar graphical display with numerous, rearrangeable sections that can be set up to mimic their actual cellar. Bottles can be added, edited, and removed with bottle graphics updating instantly to reflect the changes in data.

## Prerequisites

You will need a package manager like NPM to install the required packages.

## Installing Cellr

To install, fork this repository as well as the back-end repository. Follow the instructions for the back-end, then in the front-end run npm install. Once the packages have installed, run npm start to start the localhost server.

## Using Cellr

To use, navigate to the Sections page where you can create as many sections as you need to mimic the layout of your wine cellar. You can click the "toggle static" button to rearrange those sections as you need. Once your sections are set up, navigate to the bottle page where you can add, edit, and delete bottles from the cellar. You can click a cell to select it.
